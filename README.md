# DL_explore_synth_data
 A comprehensive survey of different deep learning architecture
 - 1. Attention model experiments on mosaic data
 - 2. Experiments on CIFAR, MNIST, and Synthetic data to see how model behaves in the presence of random noise.
 - 3. Experiments on CIFAR data with Systematic noise.
 - 4. Experiments on MNIST data with Systematic noise.
 - 5. Experiments on Elemental mosaic data.
