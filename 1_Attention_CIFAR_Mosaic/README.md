### All the experiments on Mosaic data are here.

 - 1. Simple Mosaic data Experiments using Focus Network(Where net) and Classification network (What net).
 - 2. Experiments to understand behaviour of Classification network by fixing the focus network.
 - 3. Experiments on Stage wise training of Attention Network(Focus Network + Classification Network).
 - 4. Experiments to understand Attention network by taking input for classification network from convolution layer output of Focus network.
 - 5. To understand the behaviour of Classification network on True data.
 - 6. Experiments to visualize how Attention network works with pretrained model.
