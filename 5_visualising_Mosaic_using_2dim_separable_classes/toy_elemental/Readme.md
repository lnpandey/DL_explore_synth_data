# Toy Data for visualizing mosaic data set with 


### Generationtion of 3 Classes Using 1 Dimentional data  
  data dimension,d = 1    
  classes, k = 2  
  num of foreground classes, nf = 2   
  num of background classes, bg = 1   
  - We sampled 150 (approx 50 for every class approx) 1-dim data points from uniform distribution as follows
     - class 0 UNIF(-1,0) fg-class 1
     - class 1 UNIF(0,1) fg-class 2
     - class 2 UNIF(2,3) bg-class 1
